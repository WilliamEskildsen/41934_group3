# Project reflection
<b>1. process of developing the tool</b>
- Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for your thesis?
It initiated thoughts on implementing a more automatic and early LCA for building projects. Making a thesis on LCA and how to implement them early on has not been the thought from anyone in the group and we think with 2 semesters until the thesis starts it hasn’t made us settle on a topic yet. The last project made for an interesting basis, but as we didn’t have enough time to really delve into it for now it will not be chosen as thesis purely based on this course.
- Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
The amount of use cases fit fine with what we wanted to work with. Maybe include ideas of what you could work with within the use cases next time. Have examples of code for students which makes the basic coding part easier and gets the focus to specific implementing use cases with code instead of learning overall structures.
- Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - If so, which ones would you leave out?
The number of tools was ok, but some of them were introduced in a rush, which makes it difficult to know the capabilities of the tool. Either focus more on the tools rather than on ISO 19650 or expand the course to 10 ECTS. A possibility is to make smaller breakout rooms for specific lectures such as HTML as we didn’t use this in our final project. Uploaded videos explaining different codes/tools would be nice so you can prepare before lectures.
- Would you
NO! and maybe also no

<b>2. output of the tool</b>

- Did the tool address the use case you identified?
Yes it did. We worked with LCA and our specific case was to export IFC data to LCAByg to lessen the manual work burden.
- Was the use case well modeled?
The use case was very open and up to interpretation to the student group itself. This made for a wide amount of choices within the use cases but also made it possible to scope and limit the use case to what fits the specific student capabilities which is both nice but also limits the amount of work you get done, as there might not be help/time for all the issues you might meet.
- Was the project clearly scoped?
The project was scoped in a realistic way with different goals for the aim of the tool and how far we thought we could get - and what to work next on if we were to get further than thought of.

<b>3. Future</b>

- Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis
Yes, OpenBIM and IFC are topics that are currently developing a lot and we therefore think it would be interesting to work with this in the future and possibly also in our thesis. 
- Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years?
Probably yes. It seems like there is a trend moving towards open source tools, so OpenBim might be the future, but you never know. Even more try to visualize how the tools can work for us and not the other way around.

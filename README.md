41934 Advanced BIM group 3


## Describe the use case you have chosen
We have chosen the use case LCA with the goal of making an LCA from a BIM model as simple as possible. For now the code is made as an introduction which gets the areas of windows aswell as floors. This will be used in defining the environmental impact pr. sqm of building parts.

## Who is the use case for?
This use case may be used sustainability engineers and companies interested in simplyfying LCA procedures as these can be very challenging.

## What disciplinary (non BIM) expertise did you use to solve the use case
Basic progamming knowledge combined with spatial awareness. Furthermore we used simple LCA knowledge to try and link the start of this use case with the bigger purpose of performing a full LCA.

## What IFC concepts did you use in your script (would you use in your script)
For the solution of the use case we used the IFC concept quantityset with the specific purpose of getting the entity QuantityArea. Furthermore we used the general IFC concept ObjectDefinition to get the area of the windows.

## What disciplinary analysis does it require?
Disciplinary analyses proceeding this use case would be energy engineering as installation and energy use during use phase of the model would be needed as input for a full LCA.

## What building elements are you interested in?
The use case needs all elements to make a complete LCA, however LCA's can be made for specific parts of the building aswell to asses impact of suspected high impact parts.

## What (use cases) need to be done before you can start your use case?
General architectural concept, material choices for the building and building frame calculations for heat balance and energy use. 

## What is the input data for your use case?
Material quantity, EPD's and energy use.

## What other use cases are waiting for your use case to complete?
Certification aswell as upholding relevant building requirements. However as it is an iterative process this will be done parallel with other use cases finalizing.

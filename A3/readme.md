# A3 Use Case


## 3A: Goal of the tool

1. Goal of the tool  
To provide early LCA estimations of projects with IFC models.

2. Model use  
The use case is Sustainability and the BIM use is within the category Analyse - Forecast. Our use case is the ability to use LCA to predict future impacts of the environment. Making the user able to make proactive solutions before the build phase.

## 3B: Tool / Workflow

4. Description of workflow  
The proces starts with the user adjusting the BIM model to make it usable for LCA. This means materials is needed for example. BIM file is then exported into our tool as an IFC file. The tool will then do simplified quantities and material properties to give a simple LCA assessment. Furthermore energy framing is also calculated in a simple manor. Ideally the code could include EPD's for the used materials in the building.

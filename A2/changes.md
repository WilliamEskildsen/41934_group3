# Changes to existing python and Java script

We added IfcWindows and a code that counts the total windows aswell as a function to count the area of the windows. Furthermore we illustrated with the use of javascript the specific area of windows for the chosen floor on click. The windows are sorted by level in the html document and are indented. 

## Further work

We would like to add the windows under the corresponding storey in the html but were not able to do this for now.

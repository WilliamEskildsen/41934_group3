# A4: Final Project

In this assignment we will develop a tool / workflow based on the use case you defined in the previous assignment.
The tool must:

Address your use case:
Ideally be written in Python, but can be other approaches in special cases if agreed with the course responsible.
Be summarised in a 2 minute video. You will produce one final tool in the following folders, the structure of which is summarised below.

## Tool / Workflow
The structure of this depends on the tool you have chosen to develop but it should:

be written in Python (mostly) so should contain a main.py file
if you hev used blender as the target for the tool, please also include a .blend file that we can load to check your project.
clearly seperated the code from the input data and resulting guidance (output) (if your output is a file).

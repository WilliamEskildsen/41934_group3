# A4: Final Project

## The tool
This tool uses open source licensing. The tool will help automatically fill in volumes in LCAByg 5.2.1.0 from an ifc model with the necessary data. The python identifies the walls and from here extracts the materials and the volumes of materials used for the walls. After this it identifies the file called products.json in the json template files in this repository and takes the name and index of the product (seen in code below). 


        {
                "Node": {
                    "Product": {
                        "id": "51bcec85-9105-4946-8a8a-51219bf9adfa",
                        "name": {
                            "Danish": "Test byggevare",
                            "English": "Test product",
                            "German": ""
                        },
                        "source": "User",
                        "comment": "",
                        "locked": true
                    }
                }
            }


If the name of the product matches the material name it will update the volume of the material in another json file called constructions.json in the matching section.

        {
                "Edge": [
                    {
                        "ConstructionToProduct": {
                            "id": "65cc0492-7864-4598-9254-5f929379bae6",
                            "amount": 1,
                            "unit": "M2",
                            "lifespan": 100,
                            "demolition": false,
                            "enabled": true,
                            "delayed_start": 0
                        }
                    },
                    "c6f24e0f-020a-4f0f-93c6-65beb50bd798",
                    "51bcec85-9105-4946-8a8a-51219bf9adfa"
                ]
            }

## Requirements to run tool

To run the tool you will need the following softwares and files downloaded from this 

### Softwares
1. LCAByg 5.2.1.0 (No other versions)
2. IDLE 3.1 (To run the python script with appropriate libraries)
3. IFCOpenshell 

### Files needed
1. main.py (from this repository)
2. duplex.ifc (from this repository)
3. The folder called import_example from this repository

### Stepwise guide
1. Take import_example and paste it under C:\Program Files\SBi\LCAbyg 5 (64 bit) (5.2.1.0)
2. In the above folder open engine.yaml as administrator (can be done with notepad++)
3. Add the following under the existing lines of code

       -
               name: {Danish: "Project template"}
               res: 
                     - JsonFolder: C:\Program Files\SBi\LCAbyg 5 (64 bit) (5.2.1.0)\import_example
                     - Embedded: b5ca0ecf-52fc-461c-babe-7c763dc067ef
4. Now you can run main.py code in IDLE


## Further work
To expand the tool further we want to make it more automatic to generate products and link epds from the LCAByg database to the fitting materials based on material names from ifc. Furthermore it would be the goal to strive for, that the tool may be able to build all the relating categories under LCAByg so that you would automatically have a full LCAByg file and not just material volumes. This can be done so that the tool works with speckle and can update and make quick overlays of impacts on the climate based on materials and volumes used in a building project.

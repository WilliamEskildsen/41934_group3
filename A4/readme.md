# A4: Final Project


## Requirements to run tool

To run the tool you will need the following softwares and files downloaded from this 

### Softwares
1. LCAByg 5.2.1.0 (No other versions)
2. IDLE 3.1 (To run the python script with appropriate libraries)
3. IFCOpenshell 

### Files needed
1. main.py (from this repository)
2. duplex.ifc (from this repository)
3. The folder called import_example from this repository

### Stepwise guide
1. Take import_example and paste it under C:\Program Files\SBi\LCAbyg 5 (64 bit) (5.2.1.0)
2. In the above folder open engine.yaml as administrator (can be done with notepad++)
3. Add the following under the existing lines of code
-
-
        name: {Danish: "Project template"}
        res: 
            - JsonFolder: C:\Program Files\SBi\LCAbyg 5 (64 bit) (5.2.1.0)\import_example
            - Embedded: b5ca0ecf-52fc-461c-babe-7c763dc067ef
            


In this assignment we will develop a tool / workflow based on the use case you defined in the previous assignment.
The tool must:

Address your use case:
Ideally be written in Python, but can be other approaches in special cases if agreed with the course responsible.
Be summarised in a 2 minute video. You will produce one final tool in the following folders, the structure of which is summarised below.

## Tool / Workflow
The structure of this depends on the tool you have chosen to develop but it should:

1. be written in Python (mostly) so should contain a main.py file
2. if you have used blender as the target for the tool, please also include a .blend file that we can load to check your project.
3. clearly seperated the code from the input data and resulting guidance (output) (if your output is a file).


## 2 Minute Video
- Summary of the use case / why is this a challenge?
- Who is your tool for?
- Business and societal value
- Demo of the tool (if interaction / processing takes longer â€“ edit the video ðŸ˜Š)
